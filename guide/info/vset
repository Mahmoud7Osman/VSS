set your ip and port, you can change it before and after spawning a malware

usage:      IP         PORT 
           ____       ______
   vset  <your ip>  <ypur port>

exapmle:    IP     PORT
         _________ ____
    vset 127.0.0.1 4444
  
    vset 10.0.0.44 8080
 

warning: Do not use a DNS as an address before spawning a malware:
    
     do not use this :  vset localhost 4444 
     use this        :  vset 127.0.0.1 4444
           
if you want to use ngrok, do this 

start your ngrok, copy your address without the port, like ' tcp://4.tcp.ngrok.io ' only without the port 

exapmle : ngrok tcp 4444

then use nslookup to get the ip, like 34.34.34.34

then use vset with the ip you've get by nslookup followed by the port in the ngrok address (Not 4444), then build the malware, after that, type this

vset localhost followed by Your Port you have telled ngrok to redirect connection to it

example: vset localhost 4444, then type exploit and voila.
